# **Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting:**

The gaussian elimination with pp will be broken down to those components:

1-Pivoting/Row Exchange function: rowpivot
2-Forward Elimination function: sweep
3-Back Substitution function: bksub


-The Gaussian Elimination could then be achieved by integrating those components via: pgauss
